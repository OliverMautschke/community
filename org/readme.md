# Management of github organization cloudfoundry

The projects, teams and org membership in github org 'cloudfoundry' are maintained according to a number of [RFCs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/tree/main/toc/rfc). The RFCs require PRs to one of the following files:

- [cloudfoundry.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/org/cloudfoundry.yml) - static org configuration and projects
- [contributors.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/org/contributors.yml) - list of [Contributors](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/ROLES.md#contributor)
- [TOC.md](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/TOC.md) - projects owned by the TOC (specified in yaml block)
- [Working Group Charters](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/tree/main/toc/working-groups) - projects owned by working groups (specified in yaml block)

Once approved and merged, the github action [org-management.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/actions/workflows/org-management.yml) compiles a resulting cloudfoundry org configuration from the files mentioned above and applies it with [peribolos](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow/cmd/peribolos).

[org_management.py](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/org/org-management.py) generates the following parts of the resulting cloudfoundry org configuration:

### Organization Members
Organization members are generated according to [rfc-0002-github-members](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/rfc/rfc-0002-github-members.md) and [rfc-0008-role-change-process](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/rfc/rfc-0008-role-change-process.md):
- any members specified in [cloudfoundry.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/org/cloudfoundry.yml) (should be none)
- all contributors from [contributors.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/org/contributors.yml)
- all working group leads and approvers specified in the [Working Group Charters](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/tree/main/toc/working-groups)
- org admins and TOC members must not be added to org member list

### Organization Admins
Organization admins are:
- any admin specified in [cloudfoundry.yml](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/org/cloudfoundry.yml) (should be none)
- all TOC execution leads and technical leads specified in [TOC.md](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/blob/main/toc/TOC.md) 

### Github Teams for Working Group Areas
Github Teams for the TOC, all Working Group Leads, Working Groups and Working Group Areas are generated according to [rfc-draft-github-teams-and-access.md](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/community/pull/375).
Repositories listed in the working group yaml block that belong to github organizations other than `cloudfoundry` are ignored.
